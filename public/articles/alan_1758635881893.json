The Start Menu is redesigned to focus on what matters — your pinned apps and recent files — without unnecessary clutter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Performance and Productivity\r\n\r\nWindows 11 is optimized to run more smoothly, with better memory management and faster wake times for laptops. It also introduces **Snap Layouts** — a feature that lets you quickly organize windows into grids, making multitasking much easier.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Gaming and DirectX 12 Ultimate\r\n\r\nGamers will appreciate the integration of **DirectX 12 Ultimate**, **Auto HDR**, and **DirectStorage** support, which means faster load times and better visuals on supported hardware.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Final Thoughts\r\n\r\nWindows 11 is not just a cosmetic upgrade — it’s a step forward for performance, usability, and future compatibility. Whether you’re a casual user or a gamer, it’s worth considering the upgrade if your PC meets the requirements.\r\n",
